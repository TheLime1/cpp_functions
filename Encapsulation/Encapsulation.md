Encapsulation in C++ is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. Encapsulation is designed to restrict access to the internal details of an object and to protect its integrity by preventing unauthorized or unintended access.

Key features of encapsulation in C++ include:

Private and Public Members: In C++, a class can have private, protected, and public members. Private members are only accessible from within the class itself. Public members are accessible from outside the class.

Data Hiding: Data members (attributes) are typically defined as private to hide the internal state of an object from external code. This prevents external code from directly modifying the object's data and enforces controlled access through member functions.

Access Control: Member functions (methods) of the class are used to access or modify the private data members. These functions serve as controlled interfaces to the internal state of an object.

Getters and Setters: Often, public member functions, called "getters" and "setters," are provided to read and update the private data members. This allows controlled access to the data while maintaining data integrity.
